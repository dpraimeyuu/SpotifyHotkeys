# SpotifyHotkeys

Minimal program which adds global hotkeys to Spotify. Why? Main reason since there ~is~ was no way to control the volume of Spotify without Alt+Tab'ing to the application.. 

## How to use?
Run the program. To exit; press the systray icon.

| Hotkey | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Up | Volum up |
| Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Down | Volum down |
| Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Left | Previous song |
| Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Right | Next song |
